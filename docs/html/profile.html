 <h2>Detailed profile description</h2>
 <h3>About profile</h3>
 <p>
  Profile is name for evfilter configuration. This configuration consit of
  rules that are sayning which filter(s) to load for specific device and
  parameters for these filters.<br>
  In a running system, there is one special, system profile, that should be
  used for system wide configuration, this is especially suitable for
  touchscreen callibration, persistent button renaming, and so on. This system
  profile is located in <i>/etc/evfilter/profile/</i> directory.
 </p>

 <h3>profilerc</h3>
  <p>
   File profilerc is place for rules. There are four types of keywords
   accordingly to attributes listed in <i>/proc/bus/input/devices</i> and one
   special keyword used to load filters defined in file.
  </p>

   <table border="1px" rules="rows">
    <tr>
     <td>
      <b>Device</b>
     </td>
     <td>
      Path to the input device in <i>/dev</i> filesystem. As a matter of fact
      minor and major number are compared.<br>

      Don't use this unless you really know what you are doing. Paths in
      <i>/dev/</i> filesystem are dynamically allocated unless you use some
      udev magic.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <b>Name</b>
     </td>
     <td>
      Device name as it comes from the hardware. Usually something like
      <i>"ImPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse"</i> or <i>"AT Translated Set 2
      keyboard"</i><br>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <b>Phys</b>
     </td>
     <td>
      Identifies specific connector in the computer the device is connected to.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <b>Bits</b>
     </td>
     <td>
      Identifies range of events that this device is able to generate. For
      example relative coordinates.<br>
      <i>TODO:</i> this is not correctly implemented yet. :(
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <b>File</b>
     </td>
     <td>
      File with filter(s) to load when rule was fulfilled.
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>

  <p>
   The generall syntax of file consist of lines, every line begins with one the
   keywords followed by whitespace. The rest of the line till the newline
   character is value for that keyword.<br>

   When any of rules before the first occurence of <i>File</i> keyword is
   fulfilled, this file is loaded and filters defined in this file are attached
   to the list of filters for this device.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the following example file mouse.evf will be loaded for mouse connected to 
  the ps2 connector and file set_keys.evf either for AT Translated keyboards or
  for asus extra buttons.
<pre>
 Phys isa0060/serio1/input0
 File mouse.evf
 Name AT Translated Set 2 keyboard
 Name Asus EeePC extra buttons
 File set_keys.evf
</pre>
  </p>


  <h3>filter configuration</h3>
  <p>

   Value for the <i>File</i> keyword in the previous paragraph is path to the
   file containing list of filters to load and their parameters. This file
   consist of blocks and each block defines one filter configuration starting
   with <i>FilterName = actual name</i> and ending with <i>EndFilter</i>.
   Enclosed betwen these two keywords there is a place for filter parameters.
   Each filter has it's own parameters defined.
   <br>TODO: page with filters and parameters.<br>
  </p>

   Following example says to load filter name <i>SpeedMod</i> with parameters
   <i>Xmod = 10</i> and <i>Ymod = 10</i>

<pre>
 FilterName = SpeedMod
         Xmod = 10
         Ymod = 10
 EndFilter
</pre>
