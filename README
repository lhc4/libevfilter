--------------------------------------


How to build
------------

Type 'make' in this directory. 

Currently evfilter depends on linux input
headers and inotify support.


How to install
--------------

This software is in alpha state, so
'make install' doesn't do anything yet.

In order to test system profiles you 
need to create system profile in your 
/etc. Example for this is in ./etc/ 
directory.


How to use
----------

There is nice documentation on evfilter
homepage (also available in doc/html directory).

Manpages are not written yet.

For some examples of library inteface see 
test/ directory.
